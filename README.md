# selection_sorts
my attempts at writing selection sort based on the description and comparing it with MIT OCW's example.

my approach uses for loops while MIT OCW's uses while and for loop.
using L = [79, 4, 7, 1, 66], both approaches made 7 swaps. complexity of selection sort is generally O(n^2) as there are nested loops. so I doubt in general there are any performance differences between our approaches.
